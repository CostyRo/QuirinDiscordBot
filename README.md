# QuirinDiscordBot

This was my first codding project, i wanted to develop a discord bot and i learnt Python for this.

I wanted a bot with basic commands and with a system of games and points.
The bot has 5 games:
  1. Dice
  2. Rps(rocket, papper, scissors)
  3. Roulletecolor
  4. Roulletenumber
  5. Russianroullete

Points are saved via json, maybe in the future i will do an update where i will integrate sqlite.

This project was made originally in discord.py, but when i heard the bad news that said discord.py is dead, i switched to pycord, and this is the rewrite version of the bot.

The first version wasn't publishied because when i made the bot, i didn't know about git/github because was my first personal project.
